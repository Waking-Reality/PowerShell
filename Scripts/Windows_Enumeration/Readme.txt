Good Day,

This set of scripts were tested with WinRM and Windows Firewall turned off for remote testing.
Windows_Enumeration.ps1 can be run on any host with at least Windows PowerShell 5.1 to complete all of the inital investigation items.
Manual analysis will need to be completed following this.
If your systems are setup to allow the remote enumeration, it will run automatically on the local subnet.

Ultimately this is for user files and static locations that I found important to work with.
You should look in other places that you find important on your investigations as all situations are different.

Happy Hunting,
